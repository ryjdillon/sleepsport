HCI D24 final project

Description: Student-athletes do not usually place a high priority on getting
consistent amounts of sleep, despite the connection between getting
enough sleep and performing well in both academics and athletics.
While several apps exist that are designed to track sleep, few
have manual entry, relying on smart devices to automatically track
movement and heart rate in order to calculate sleep time and quality.
None of these apps are specifically geared towards athletes and have
no functionality for tracking workouts and practices along with sleep
data.
The approach of this project to fill the gap for student athletes
will be a manual entry program where users can log their sleep times,
practices, and any notes on sleep quality or practice difficulty. They
will be able to see visualizations of their sleep habits, as well as see
statistics related to their sleep trends and practices. 

Key Features:
1. Creating a log of the previous dayâ€™s workouts and sleep data.
2. Viewing a graph and statistics of recent sleep habits.
Both features allow the user to track their recent sleep habits
and see any correlation between athletic activity and sleep time
and/or quantity.

This is not a fully implemented application, only a hi-fi prototype. All data is canned, and the only features fully implemented are filling out the log form and viewing/interacting with the graph.
